**Instructions:**

1. Do not generate all 30 questions at onceâ€”please do so in **batches of 10**.
2. Follow the same question structure throughout.
3. Questions should be difficult and require critical thinking, just like the example above.
4. Once the questions are generated, I will request the answers in a follow-up.
